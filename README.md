# OnlyFish Marker Pack
This Marker Pack is primarily developed by Metallis.6105 (Discord: Metallis#9388) with significant help from the following folks.
 - maanlichtje
 - LDR
 - Neroc
 - HeroineDark
 - HexedHero

I also receive information from various people on the [Blish HUD Discord](https://discord.gg/FYKN3qh).

I develop this pack as I have time (read: please understand pack updates may not come quickly) and focus my efforts primarily on usage with [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) over [GW2 TacO](http://www.gw2taco.com/) as Blish provides some nice QoL features to make the markers and trails a little less obtrusive while still being useful. 

I strive to make my markers and trails (especially trails) as inclusive as possible and will be doing everything in my power to use the following [all-variant-colorblind-friendly color palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%23E69F00-%2356B4E9-%23009E73-%23F0E442-%230072B2-%23D55E00-%23CC79A7) wherever possible! I highly encourage my other packmaker friends to adopt these where possible, the decision was made with what input I could gather from colorblind friends.

There are 3 color variants of the marker pin that can be used by editing the `.xml` itself. (You could even apply them to different categories if you wanted to.)

If you have an idea for a marker pack you want me (or someone) to try and tackle, please submit your ideas [HERE](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/discussions/categories/requested-marker-packs)!

Support: You may find me on the [Metal's Marker-mancy](https://discord.gg/FP8dQj6KBj) Discord! This is for all my packs!

I [do accept donations](https://ko-fi.com/metallis) if you truly wish to offer more than your kind words. They're never expected, but they're absolutely always appreciated.
